Bulls &amp; Cows game.

Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.

This version of Bulls &amp; Cows is a code-breaking word game. Try to figure out the isogram with a limited number of turns.
